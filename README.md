# Headphone-disconnect
### Overview
The idea behind this program is to disconnect your headphone when closing your macbook. This is a nice to have since your headphone could have trouble connecting to other devices (ex. your phone) because it's still connected to your closed macbook.

### Warning
<ins>This package is not finished, use at your own risk.</ins>

Also, it does not hook into any kind of event yet, so you would have to do that yourself.

### Alternative Solutions
https://github.com/odlp/bluesnooze, but these disable Bluetooth entirely which makes your Apple Watch unable to unlock your macbook.
### Todo checklist:
- [ ] Check out Sleep Watcher as an event hook.
- [ ] Check if using blueutil only is easier.
- [ ] Testing
